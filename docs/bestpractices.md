# Best Practices

This document outlines some best practices for using DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, and other concepts that relate to Wallet-SDK.

## DIDs

* It is encouraged to generate a new DID for each credential issuance for holder binding. This is considered best practice since the DID cannot be used as a correlating identifier.
