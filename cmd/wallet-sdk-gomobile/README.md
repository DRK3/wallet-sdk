# Wallet SDK Gomobile

This package contains the `gomobile`-compatible version of the SDK.

Currently, it only has a set of interface definitions, which are similar to the ones 
in [pkg/api.go](https://github.com/trustbloc/wallet-sdk/blob/main/pkg/api.go), but modified to
be compatible with `gomobile`.
